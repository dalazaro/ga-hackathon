# GA Hackathon: LinkedIn reformat

*This repository contains prototypes made for the Hackathon at General Assembly on 8/19/2017. We were a five-person team called DevelList, and our mission was to come up with a reformatting the website LinkedIn such that a user's skills and endorsements listed on his/her page were more prominent and more of a priority to recruiters and hiring managers.*
